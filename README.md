# YAPP
YAPP or (Yet Another Print-head Project) is a custom 3D printer tool-head designed to print with two materials in the same print. With minimal to no oozing thanks to OPS (Ooze Prevention System.) Shares the EVA 2.0 form factor to maximize compatibility with other modifications. Was built for a RatRig V-Core 3 400, but should work for other sizes. For V-Core 3.1, I'm unsure of the belt spacing. USE WITH CAUTION. Later updates will include patches for such issues.
