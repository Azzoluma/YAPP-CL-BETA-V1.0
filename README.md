# YAPP
YAPP or (Yet Another Print-head Project) is a custom 3D printer tool-head designed to print with two materials in the same print. With minimal to no oozing thanks to OPS (Ooze Prevention System.) Shares the EVA 2.0 form factor to maximize compatibility with other modifications. Was built for a RatRig V-Core 3 400, but should work for other sizes. For V-Core 3.1, I'm unsure of the belt spacing. USE WITH CAUTION. Later updates will include patches for such issues.

Currently only supporting Orbiter 2.0 and Vz-HextrudORT with Phaetus Rapido and Slice Engineering Mosquito. More options to come shortly.

Proper documentation will be made ASAP. For now use the STEP files, *Cap Head screws are not all the correct length in the assembly, only use as a guide until further notice.
